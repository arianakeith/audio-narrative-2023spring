In my preview "All Nighter" mp3 file I am showing the start to my project heavily relying upon layering. The whole theme for my project is the busyness or cluttered feeling that comes with the duration of my audio narrative. As someone is cramming for a night of studying, it is one thing on top of another in this race to the finish line. By layering the different audio files of actions one would do throughout the night I am trying to represent that feeling. The preview I have is in the very beginning stages as I still have a lot of work to do but I am on track to continue building this soundscape. Most of my sounds are sourced and stored in my asset list already, however the recorded audio of me making a cup of coffee has not yet been uploaded. This is going to be the next stage of my project I will work on. As I am building up the layers and creating a chaotic 30 seconds or so section of sound, I am going to cut the audio, to resemble the student needing a break from the chaos in her mind. After the “scene” with coffee is completed, the “break” is over and the student must get back to work, so the previous audio files will come back. There will be a clock that slowly starts ticking in this final section of my audio narrative until a final alarm goes off and the student speaks the words “it’s time” and the audio cuts off. I am not sure how long this coffee break should be. Any recommendations? I do not want it to be too big of a distraction from the main objective of the piece, however, this change in the audio is important as I feel like it will add depth and a creative turn.

Here is the static screensho of my Audacity file in progress.
