###Future Home of Ariana's Audio Project "All Nighter"

For my audio narrative project I am trying to represent a college kid cramming a night of studying before a big exam the next day. The environment I am trying to create will just be a college kids room. The story will surround the college kid at their desk and follow them throughout their night of studying. It will detail what an “all-nighter” looks or more so, sounds like. I want to add a kind of suspenseful theme to represent the feeling of stress the college student is feeling while studying through the night until it reaches morning.
