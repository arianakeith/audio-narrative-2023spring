Future Home of Ariana's Audio Project "All Nighter"

For my audio narrative project I am representing a college student cramming a night of studying before a big exam the next day. The environment I am trying to create will consist of the college students bedroom. The story will surround the college kid at their desk and follow them throughout their nightly routine of studying. It will detail what an ‚Äúall-nighter‚Äù looks or more so, sounds like. I want to add a kind of suspenseful theme to represent the feeling of stress the college student is feeling while studying through the night until it reaches morning.
